## About the project
This is an apps to play Blackjack by using TKInter module and random module in Python.
random.randint() and random.seed(1), which are ensuring that they are dealt with an equal probability.
It is possible to play a game match against a virtual opponent as a dealer.
This app can be working well when you kill a time!
However, this project has not sufficiently considered user graphics. Therefore, I believe that a more visually appealing version can be created by incorporating more photos and motion, or by using JavaScript React.
