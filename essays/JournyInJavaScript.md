    I feel JavaScript is between Python and Java in terms of its functionality and style of coding. For example, when I create a function with a few parameters, in Java, C or C++, I have to define what data type of parameter I would pass and I have to define what data type of the function is, which means what data type of output the function returns after calling. This feature sounds like more Python than Java or C languages. Besides that, I do not have to write code inside a main function unlike Java or C do. However, in terms of grammar, such as switch statements, increment/decrement operators, I feel it is more similar to Java or C.
    I am not sure if this language is useful for soft engineering yet since I did not have an experience of JavaScript before the class and I did not get used to it. Additionally, the WOD is useful for me to practice this language in a more practical way. One problem I face when I start programming is that I do not have an idea how to apply the elemental knowledge of the language to any application or what I want to do. Thanks to the WOD, I feel it is clearly testing your understanding of this language and leading us in the right direction.
    One concern for now is JavaScript requires me to do HTML/CSS at the same time to use it, but I am not familiar with them, even though I have experience with them. Even though those languages are quite different from other languages, especially what I usually use for data science or data analysis, I am kind of worried about it.
