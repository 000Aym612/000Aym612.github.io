## Reasons for Using a UI Framework
The primary reason for using a UI framework is to save the time for development.
The frame work allows for the implementation of designs without writing the same code as the original. Unless you have to rewrite the exactly same code as someone else has already developed to implement a function. This advantage becomes particularly apparent when working on projects in a group.
For example, by leveraging a framework, developers can eliminate the need to create designs from scratch.
This allows developers to focus more on essential features, reducing both the time and cost of the project.
This not only saves time for the engineers who are in charge of the projects for the development but also results in cost savings on labor for the company.
Additionally, these UI frameworks, which offer a large amount of features or functions, provide a consistent design to customers. Therefore, from a user's perspective, it can be anticipated that web pages that are easy to understand and use will be created and delivered.
