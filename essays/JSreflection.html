    <h1>My Journey with JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        I've noticed that <strong>JavaScript</strong> shares similarities with both <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Java/C/C++</strong>. Its approach to functions, 
        where the data type of parameters or the return type isn't explicitly stated, is reminiscent of Python's flexibility. 
        This is a contrast to the strict type definitions required in Java, C, or C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike Java or C, JavaScript doesn't require a main function to execute code. However, its grammar, including elements like switch 
        statements and increment/decrement operators, aligns more closely with Java and C.

    <h2>Exploring JavaScript's Utility in Software Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        As a newcomer to JavaScript, I'm still exploring its utility in software engineering. The <strong>Workout of the Day (WOD)</strong> exercises in my class have 
        been instrumental in applying basic JavaScript concepts to practical scenarios, enhancing my understanding and guiding me in the right direction.
    </p>

    <h2>Concerns and Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        One challenge I face is integrating JavaScript with <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>. Although my background in data science and data analysis 
        involves different skill sets, I'm concerned about my unfamiliarity with HTML/CSS, which seems essential for effective JavaScript usage.
