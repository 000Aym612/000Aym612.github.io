## Functional Aspects of Design Patterns
design pattern has different aspects such as creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

### Creational Patterns:
**Creational patterns** deal with object creation mechanisms. 

**Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

**Builder:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Structural Patterns:
**Structural patterns** are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Examples include:

**Adapter:** Allows interfaces of incompatible objects to work together.

**Decorator:** Adds new functionality to an object dynamically.

**Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### Behavioral Patterns:
**Behavioral patterns** are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

**Observer:** Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

**Strategy:** Enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.

**Command:** Encapsulates a command request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests.
